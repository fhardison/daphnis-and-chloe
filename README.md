# Daphnis and Chloe

STATUS: Ongoing lemmatization; diglot complete.

This repo is a lemmatization project for _Daphnis and Chloe_ by Longus as well as an English-Greek diglot. 

The final format of the lemmatization will be the format used by James Tauber's [vocabulary-tools]() so that it can be processed by the same toolset. 

The lemmatization is being done with a custom toolset based on the form-lemma mappings from [Eulexis](https://github.com/PhVerkerk/Eulexis_off_line) which is released under a [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
